# Fake News Detection System  
With the rapid advances in Machine Learning algorithms and their learning abilities, a system can be made to distinguish the fake news from the real news, making sure the morale of people doesnâ€™t get affected and people are not swayed away by such information disorder.  
  
To design such system, we propose the development of an AI based software which will:  
* Evaluate the existing real news from the Kaggle dataset.  
* Learn and determine which features contribute to real news and which contributes to fake ones.  
* Train the model for the given training dataset.  
* For a given fresh news, determine whether the news is trusted a.k.a. real or not.  

# How to Use  
1. Download both the Fake News and Real News Datasets.  
1. Open *face-news-detect.ipynb* to see the code and then upload the datasets in the notebook, by dragging and dropping the downloaded zip files.  
1. Run all the subsequent cells to see the working of the project.
